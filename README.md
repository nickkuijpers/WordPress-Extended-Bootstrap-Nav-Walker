# WordPress-Extended-Bootstrap-Nav-Walker
A extended WordPress nav walker for manipulating classes based on the created navigation.

I have extended the awesome method of https://github.com/twittem/wp-bootstrap-navwalker for manipulating the WordPress navigation. 

This function will give you the possibility of manipulating the classes the WordPress navigation creates. Please see the preview attached.
